            I'm <strong>Jivanshu Mishra</strong>, an 18-year-old Computer Engineering student at DJ Sanghvi College, specializing in IoT, Cybersecurity, and Blockchain.<br /><br />
            I'm a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> skilled in the MERN stack and Flask, currently focused on building practical projects like a smart study scheduler and a financial dashboard.<br /><br />
            Iâ€™m also passionate about IoT systems, exploring how hardware and software interact. With a solid base in DSA, I enjoy solving problems and turning ideas into efficient solutions.<br /><br />
            Outside tech, I love mentoring kids in science, staying fit, and watching story-driven shows and games like <strong>Peaky Blinders</strong> and <strong>Ghost of Tsushima</strong>.
